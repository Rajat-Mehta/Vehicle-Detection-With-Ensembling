This is the script that we used for evaluating our ensemble model.

localization_evaluation.py: this script was provided by MIO-TCD challenge organizers to evaluate our final model. It accepts two parameters: ground truth csv file and our result csv file

Command: python localization_evaluation.py ../data_set_files/gt_val_10-20k.csv ../ensemble_scripts/dets_numpy/results/result_ensemble_sfe.csv

where, gt_val_10-20k.csv is the part of validation set which was not seen by the model before and
result_ensemble_sfe.csv file contains the result of our ensemble model for the last 10,000 images(gt_val_10-20k.csv) of our validation dataset. This csv file was generated by the "read_detections_from_file.py" script in  "ensemble_script" folder.
