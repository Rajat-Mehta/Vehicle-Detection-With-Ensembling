All of the sub-folders present in this folder contains the saved detection outputs of individual models in numpy files. The outputs were saved so that we don't need to predict detection outputs of these models again and again(which usually takes too long to run on the whole validation set). These saved numpy files were later on loaded to be fed into the ensemble model in "predict_boxes.py" and "read_detections_from_file.py" scripts.
